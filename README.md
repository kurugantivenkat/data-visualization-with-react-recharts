# Recharts

- Recharts is a Redefined chart library built with React and D3.
- Recharts makes it easy to integrate charts into your React application.

**Main principles of Recharts are:**

***Composable*** - Quickly build your charts with decoupled, reusable React components.

***Reliable*** - Built on top of SVG elements with a lightweight dependency on D3 submodules.

***Powerful*** - Customize your chart by tweaking component props and passing in custom components.

**Installation:**

`npm install recharts @types/recharts`
